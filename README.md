# ChatGPT Clone

This project is a simple clone of a chat application using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. It includes a React frontend for the user interface and an Express server to interact with the OpenAI API. Users can input messages, and the application will generate responses using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: The application provides a clean and user-friendly interface for users to interact with.

- **Chat History**: The sidebar displays a history of unique chat titles, allowing users to review their previous conversations.

- **Dynamic Chat Feed**: The main section dynamically updates to show the ongoing chat feed, including user input and GPT-generated responses.

- **New Chat Button**: Users can start a new chat session by clicking the "+ New Chat" button in the sidebar.

   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   # Navigate to the command line and install dependencies

## Areas of Improvement

1. **Error Handling**: Implementation of robust error handling mechanisms for API calls and other potential errors to enhance the user experience.

2. **Loading States**: Addition of loading indicators or messages to inform users when the application is processing a request.

3. **User Authentication**: Integration of user authentication to allow users to have personalized chat histories and experiences.

4. **Responsive Design**: Enhancement of the application's responsiveness to different screen sizes and devices for a better user experience.

5. **Optimization**: Optimization of the codebase for better performance, and consider implementing features like pagination for large chat histories.

6. **User Feedback**: Provision of feedback to users on the status of their requests, such as success messages or error notifications.

7. **Documentation**: Enhancement of the documentation, including adding inline comments, to make the codebase more understandable for developers who may contribute to or maintain the project.

8. **Deployment**: Deployment of project in a live environment for others to access without having to be a needy!

9. **Add onKeyDown for Input:**
